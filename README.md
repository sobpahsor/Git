This is the code and .csv files of my coursework. I will anounce several matters need attention here.

1. Please run the ClearZeroColumn and ClearZeroRow function before preprocessing and save the output of these files as reuters.
2. I do not recommend you to run the preprocessng code, since it is very time consuming. The preprocess would run about 3 hours.
   If you want to run the code, I think change the loop variable is a good method.
3. The LDA function is also very time consuming and the result is not stable, the LDA_Feature.csv file is the result of the first time I run LDA. Moeover, the LDA related data used in following questions are all based oon that LDA_Feature.csv file. 
4. Different LDA document term matrix might influence the Chi.square function, but don't worry, this function is not very important.
5. The treetag function in the preprocessing needs external files, the detail of how to download those files have been wirtten beyond
   the function in Task1:Preprocessing file.
6. Just select the code and run it.
